# Codefinder
Codefinder is a collection of functions which permit the learning of probabilistic nucleotide pairing matrices from sets of motifs. In practice, this code was used on motifs arising from triplexRNA-sequencing and triplexDNA-sequencing in order to learn RNA-DNA pairing probabilities, which were subsequently implemented as substition matrices in the _R_ package _TriplexAligner_.
